A distributed scrabble cheating tool written in Go. It really has no reason to exist.
I just wanted to try out go, zeromq and protocol buffers respectively.

## Dependencies
    * zeromq 4 http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software
    * zmq4 https://github.com/pebbe/zmq4
    * protocol buffers https://github.com/google/protobuf
    * protobuf https://github.com/golang/protobuf
